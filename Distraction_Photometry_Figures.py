# JEM function for scatter bar plots
"""
This function will create bar+scatter plots when passed a 1 or 2 dimensional
array. Data needs to be passed in as a numpy object array, e.g.
data = np.empty((2), dtype=np.object)
data[0] = np.array(allData['nCasLicks'][index])
data[1] = np.array(allData['nMaltLicks'][index])
Various options allow specification of colors and paired/unpaired plotting.
It can return the figures, axes, bars, and scatters for further modification.
e.g.
fig1, ax1, barlist1, sc1 = barscatter(data)
for i in barlist1[1].get_children():
    i.set_color('g')
